# About project
This is an application that receives FishText using the site Api https://fish-text.ru/ to fill in text in layouts.
FishText is used by designers, planners and frontenders when you need to quickly fill layouts or prototypes with content. This is a test content that should not make any sense, just show the presence of the text itself or demonstrate the typography in the case.
You can get both the number of sentences, paragraphs and headings up to 25
